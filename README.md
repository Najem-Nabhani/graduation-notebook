# Online Graduation Notebook

## About
When I was about to graduate early-2021, everyone was in lockdown due COVID-19, we lost the pleasure of exchanging fairwell message on our graduation notebooks. There existed online notebooks at the time, but I didnâ€™t like the format and wanted my own customizations, so I have created this to allow friends and family to write for me :)
